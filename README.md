# Just-Tech-News

# Description

In this module, I built the back end for my first completely full-stack application. Just Tech News—a tech news is a website where users can post, upvote, and comment on links to news articles. I used used Sequelize, an object-relational mapping (ORM) library, to simplify my MySQL queries, add password hashing so that users can create secure passwords, and connected my application to JawsDB, a MySQL add-on for Heroku.
